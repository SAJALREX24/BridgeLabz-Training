🎯 Objective & Tasks of the Day

* The objective of the day was to apply collections, string manipulation, and exception handling concepts by designing scenario-based applications. The task assigned was to analyze and  * design two mini applications: a digital bookshelf app and a movie schedule manager, focusing on clean method design and robust error handling.



✅ Work Completed

* Analyzed the BookBuddy – Digital Bookshelf App problem statement
* Designed methods to add, sort, and search books using collections
* Worked with ArrayList to store and manage book information
* Applied string operations to split and process book data
* Studied and applied custom exception handling for invalid input formats
* Analyzed the CinemaTime – Movie Schedule Manager scenario
* Designed methods to add, search, and display movie schedules
* Handled runtime exceptions related to invalid indices and time formats
* Converted collections to arrays for reporting and export functionality



📚 Concepts Learned

* ArrayList and List collections
* Storing and managing data using collections
* String manipulation using split() and contains()
* Method design for CRUD-like operations
* Custom exceptions and exception handling
* Handling empty collections using try-catch
* Data formatting using string concatenation and format()
* Converting collections to arrays




🛠 Tools / Technologies Used

* Java Programming Language
* Collections Framework
* Exception Handling mechanisms

  

⚠️ Challenges Faced

* Validating input formats for books and showtimes
* Designing custom exceptions for specific error cases
* Handling empty lists and invalid search operations gracefully




🧩 Solution / Approach

* Used ArrayList and List to store dynamic data
* Applied string parsing techniques to separate and process input values
* Created custom exception classes for invalid data formats
* Used try-catch blocks to handle runtime errors safely
* Converted collections to arrays before generating output reports



🎯 Key Takeaways

* Collections provide flexibility in managing dynamic data
* Exception handling is critical for building robust applications
* Clear method definitions improve code readability and maintainability
* Scenario-based problems enhance real-world application design skills
